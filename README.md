This is a set of shell scripts using the `fish` or `bash` shell to write DROP ICE, or ABOLISH ICE, on your
GitHub graph.

Run the `dropice.sh` or `dropice_bash.sh` script and pass it the year, month, and day you want the
phrase to end. In the `DROP ICE` screenshot below, I ran it as:
`./dropice.sh 2020 08 30` because that's where the end of the E is.

Becuase it makes 100 commits every day, it will force all your other commit squares to go pale. If
you make a bunch of commits in a day, you can turn up the number of commits in the `datefill.sh`
file.

You can see `DROP ICE` in action on [my graph][graph]. The commits are in my [account repository][ar].

If you'd rather `ABOLISH ICE` then run it as `./dropice.sh <year> <month> <day> abolish`.

When you start loosing the start of the first word because time moves, you can delete the repository
you pushed to github that has all the commits, and then make a new one with new dates!
